# Gesture-Recognition
This project utilizes Python with MediaPipe and OpenCV to enable real-time gesture recognition from live video feeds. It detects and maps hand landmarks, converting them into actionable commands based on predefined gestures. The system controls mouse movements, clicks, scrolling, and system settings such as brightness and volume adjustments, enhancing user interaction with the computer through intuitive hand gestures. Future improvements could focus on expanding gesture capabilities and refining accuracy for broader application scenarios.
